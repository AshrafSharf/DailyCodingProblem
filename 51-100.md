This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive), where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an array using only swaps.

It should run in O(N) time.

Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.

## 52 [Hard]

 This problem was asked by Google.

Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size `n`, and contain the following methods:

- `set(key, value)`: sets `key` to `value`. If there are already `n` items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least recently used item.
- `get(key)`: gets the value at `key`. If no such key exists, return null.

Each operation should run in O(1) time.

Implement a queue using two stacks. Recall that a queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure with the following methods: `enqueue`, which inserts an element into the queue, and `dequeue`, which removes it.

Sudoku is a puzzle where you're given a partially-filled 9 by 9 grid with digits. The objective is to fill the grid with the constraint that every row, column, and box (3 by 3 subgrid) must contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## 55 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

- `shorten(url)`, which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as `zLg6wl`.
- `restore(short)`, which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.

Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?

Given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix and an integer k, write a function to determine whether each vertex in the graph can be colored such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color using at most k colors.

## 57 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple lines such that each line has a length of k or less. You must break it up so that words don't break across lines. Each line has to have the maximum possible amount of words. If there's no way to break the text up, then return null.

You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there is exactly one space between each word.

For example, given the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and k = 10, you should return: ["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]. No string in the list has a length of more than 10.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

An sorted array of integers was rotated an unknown number of times.

Given such an array, find the index of the element in the array in faster than linear time. If the element doesn't exist in the array, return null.

For example, given the array [13, 18, 25, 2, 8, 10] and the element 8, return 4 (the index of 8 in the array).

You can assume all the integers in the array are unique.

Implement a file syncing algorithm for two computers over a low-bandwidth network. What if we know the files in the two computers are mostly the same?SOL

## 60 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a multiset of integers, return whether it can be partitioned into two subsets whose sums are the same.

For example, given the multiset `{15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 15, 10}`, it would return true, since we can split it up into `{15, 5, 10, 15, 10}`and `{20, 35},` which both add up to `55`.

Given the multiset `{15, 5, 20, 10, 35}`, it would return false, since we can't split it up into two subsets that add up to the same sum.

## 61 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the `pow(x, y)`function, where `x` and `y` are integers and returns `x^y`.

Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.

For example, `pow(2, 10)` should return 1024.

## 62 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

For example, given a 2 by 2 matrix, you should return 2, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:

- Right, then down
- Down, then right

Given a 5 by 5 matrix, there are 70 ways to get to the bottom-right.
