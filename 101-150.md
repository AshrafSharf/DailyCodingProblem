## 101 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Alibaba.

Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.

A solution will always exist. See [Goldbach’s conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture).

Example:

```
Input: 4
Output: 2 + 2 = 4
```

If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.

If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, then

```
[a, b] < [c, d]
```

If a < c OR a==c AND b < d.

This problem was asked by Lyft.

Given a list of integers and a number K, return which contiguous elements of the list sum to K.

For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and K is 9, then it should return [2, 3, 4], since 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.

## 122 [Medium]

This question was asked by Zillow.

You are given a 2-d `matrix` where each cell represents number of coins in that cell. Assuming we start at `matrix[0][0]`, and can only move right or down, find the maximum number of coins you can collect by the bottom right corner.

For example, in this matrix

```
0 3 1 1
2 0 0 4
1 5 3 1
```

The most we can collect is 0 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12 coins.

## 126 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` rotated by two becomes `[3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]`. Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?

SOLUTION. https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/solution/



## 127 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. The nodes make up the number in reversed order.

For example, the following linked list:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

is the number 54321.

Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.

For example, given

```
9 -> 9
5 -> 2
```

return 124 (99 + 25) as:

```
4 -> 2 -> 1
```



## 128 [Medium]

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle game with three rods and n disks, each a different size.

All the disks start off on the first rod in a stack. They are ordered by size, with the largest disk on the bottom and the smallest one at the top.

The goal of this puzzle is to move all the disks from the first rod to the last rod while following these rules:

- You can only move one disk at a time.
- A move consists of taking the uppermost disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
- You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.

Write a function that prints out all the steps necessary to complete the Tower of Hanoi. You should assume that the rods are numbered, with the first rod being 1, the second (auxiliary) rod being 2, and the last (goal) rod being 3.

For example, with n = 3, we can do this in 7 moves:

```
Move 1 to 3
Move 1 to 2
Move 3 to 2
Move 1 to 3
Move 2 to 1
Move 2 to 3
Move 1 to 3
```



## 129 [Medium]

Given a real number `n`, find the square root of n. For example, given `n = 9`, return `3`.



## 130 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order and an integer `k`, return the maximum profit you can make from `k` buys and sells. You must buy the stock before you can sell it, and you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.

For example, given `k` = 2 and the array `[5, 2, 4, 0, 1]`, you should return 3.

## 131 [Medium]

This question was asked by Snapchat.

Given the head to a singly linked list, where each node also has a “random” pointer that points to anywhere in the linked list, deep clone the list.



## 132 [Easy]

This question was asked by Riot Games.

Design and implement a HitCounter class that keeps track of requests (or hits). It should support the following operations:

- `record(timestamp)`: records a hit that happened at `timestamp`
- `total()`: returns the total number of hits recorded
- `range(lower, upper)`: returns the number of hits that occurred between timestamps `lower` and `upper` (inclusive)

Follow-up: What if our system has limited memory?



## 133 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a node in a binary search tree, return the next bigger element, also known as the inorder successor.

For example, the inorder successor of 22 is 30.

```
   10
  /  \
 5    30
     /  \
   22    35
```

You can assume each node has a `parent` pointer.
